# PortefeuilleCMS
This is an eclectic little CMS I am currently building for [gertrietveld.com](http://gertrietveld.com)

It uses [HttpFoundation](https://github.com/symfony/http-foundation) component from Symfony, [AltoRouter](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/AltoRouter) for routing, [Twig](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig) templates and the [Eloquent](https://github.com/illuminate/database) ORM from Laravel.

The responsive design uses [PureCss](https://purecss.io/).

The admin part is built with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
